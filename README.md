# I-Am-Feeling-Hungry
 Main Repo
 
 for me:
 - figure out how to save both restaurant 
    - options: 1) only id and timestamp 2) id, timestamp, name, category, address
 - figure out how to do update listeners
    - options: 1) just find deleted or added id and remove/add from list? 2) reload the entire recycler view every time it updates?
 
 notes from greg:
 - add error validation on empty location
 - changed misspelling on method
 - put sign out button in settings page
 - add randomization
 - refactor in packages and import?
